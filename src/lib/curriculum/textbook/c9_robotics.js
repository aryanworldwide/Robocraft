      { h: 'Defining a robot properly', b: `A **robot** is a programmable machine that can **sense** its surroundings, **process** that information to make decisions, and **act** on the physical world — with some degree of **autonomy** (working without a human controlling every step).

The Robot Institute of America defined an industrial robot as "a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools or specialised devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks". Two words in that definition matter for exams:
• **Reprogrammable** — the same robot can be given a new program for a new job (a fixed machine cannot).
• **Multifunctional** — it can do more than one kind of task (weld today, paint tomorrow).

**Robotics** is the branch of engineering and science that deals with the design, construction, operation and use of robots, together with the computer systems that control them.` },
      { h: 'Characteristics of a robot', b: `Every robot shows these characteristics:
• **Sensing** — it uses sensors (camera, IR, ultrasonic, touch, temperature) to collect information.
• **Movement** — it can move itself (wheels, legs, propellers) or move parts of itself (an arm).
• **Energy** — it needs a power source: battery, mains electricity, hydraulic or pneumatic power.
• **Intelligence / programmability** — a controller runs a program that decides what to do.
• **Autonomy** — it can carry out a task with little or no human help.
• **Interaction** — it affects its environment (picks, places, cleans, welds, talks).` },
      { h: 'Benefits of robots', b: `The syllabus lists five key benefits:
1. **Quality** — robots repeat the same movement with the same precision every time, so products have fewer defects.
2. **Productivity** — they work faster and do not need breaks, so more is produced per hour.
3. **Efficiency** — less material is wasted and energy can be used more carefully.
4. **Working span** — a robot can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for years.
5. **Hazardous environments** — robots can work where it is unsafe for people: bomb disposal, nuclear plants, deep sea, outer space, mines, fire and chemical spills.

Other benefits: accuracy in surgery, doing boring repetitive jobs, lifting very heavy loads, and helping elderly or disabled people.` },
      { h: 'Limitations of robots', b: `Robots are powerful but have limits:
• **High cost** — buying, installing and maintaining robots is expensive.
• **No common sense or emotions** — a robot only does what it is programmed or trained to do; it cannot truly understand feelings.
• **Limited adaptability** — an unexpected situation can confuse a robot.
• **Needs skilled people** — programmers and technicians are required to set it up and repair it.
• **Power dependence** — no power means no work.
• **Job displacement** — robots can replace some human jobs, though they also create new jobs (robot programmers, technicians, designers).
• **Safety risk** — a fast, heavy robot arm can injure people if safety rules are ignored.` },
      { h: 'Physical robots and software bots', b: `Not every "robot" has a body. A **software bot** is a program that automates tasks — for example a chatbot answering customer questions, or RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bots filling forms. Physical robots have sensors and actuators; software bots work only with data. In this course, "robot" normally means a physical robot.` },

        { q: 'Give the origin of the word "robot".', a: 'It comes from the Czech word **robota**, meaning forced labour. It was first used by Karel Čapek in his 1920 play **R.U.R. (Rossum\'s Universal Robots)**.' },
        { q: 'State any two limitations of robots.', a: '• High initial and maintenance cost.\n• They lack common sense/emotions and cannot easily handle unexpected situations.\n(Also accepted: need skilled operators, depend on power, may displace jobs.)' },

      long: [
        { q: 'Explain any five benefits of using robots, with an example for each.', a: '1. **Quality** — consistent precision, e.g. robots welding car bodies give identical welds.\n2. **Productivity** — faster output, e.g. a packing robot packs hundreds of items per minute.\n3. **Efficiency** — less waste, e.g. spray-painting robots use exactly the paint needed.\n4. **Working span** — work 24×7, e.g. warehouse robots run all night.\n5. **Hazardous environments** — e.g. bomb-disposal robots and Mars rovers do work unsafe for humans.' },
        { q: 'Describe the characteristics that make a machine a robot.', a: 'A robot (1) **senses** its environment using sensors; (2) has a **controller/program** that processes data and decides; (3) **acts/moves** using actuators; (4) needs an **energy source**; (5) works with **autonomy**; and (6) is **reprogrammable** for different tasks. Example: a Roomba senses walls and dirt, decides a path, drives its wheels and brushes, runs on a battery and works on its own.' },

    figs: ['sensePlanAct'],
    sections: [
      { h: 'The Sense–Plan–Act loop in detail', b: `Every robot repeats three steps many times each second:
• **Sense** — read the sensors. Example: an ultrasonic sensor reports "obstacle at 18 cm".
• **Plan (think)** — the controller compares readings with its program or model. "18 cm is less than my 20 cm safety limit, so I must turn."
• **Act** — the controller sends signals to actuators: left motor forward, right motor backward → the robot turns.

After acting, the world has changed, so the robot senses again. This repeated loop is called a **control loop**. A fast loop (e.g. 100 times a second) makes a robot react smoothly; a slow loop makes it clumsy.` },
      { h: 'Feedback', b: `When a robot measures the result of its own action and uses that measurement to correct the next action, it is using **feedback**. A line-following robot is a good example: if its sensor sees that it has drifted left of the line, it steers right; if it drifts right, it steers left. Without feedback the robot would simply drive in whatever direction it was pointed.

[fig:openClosedLoop]` },
      { h: 'Levels of autonomy', b: `Robots are not simply "autonomous" or "not autonomous" — there are levels:
1. **Manual / teleoperated** — a human controls every movement by remote (bomb-disposal robot driven by a soldier).
2. **Assisted** — the human gives commands, the robot handles details (a drone that holds its height by itself).
3. **Semi-autonomous** — the robot does most of the job but a human supervises (a surgical robot guided by a doctor).
4. **Fully autonomous** — the robot completes the whole task by itself (a Mars rover driving to a target rock when radio delay makes remote control impossible).` },
      { h: 'Why a washing machine is not a full robot', b: `A washing machine follows a fixed program: fill, wash, rinse, spin. Some models sense water level or load, but they cannot change their goal, move around, or deal with new situations. So it is an **automated machine**, not a full robot. The more a machine senses, decides for itself and adapts, the more "robot-like" it is.` },

      short: [
        { q: 'What is the Sense–Plan–Act cycle?', a: 'It is the basic operating loop of a robot: **sense** the environment with sensors, **plan** (decide) using the controller, and **act** using actuators — repeated continuously.' },
        { q: 'What is meant by feedback in a robot?', a: 'Feedback is information from sensors about the result of the robot\'s own action, used to correct its next action (e.g. a line follower steering back onto the line).' },

        { q: 'Differentiate between a robot and an automated machine with two examples of each.', a: '• A **robot** senses its environment, decides for itself and acts with autonomy; it can be reprogrammed — e.g. Roomba, autonomous drone.\n• An **automated machine** follows a fixed sequence with little sensing or decision-making — e.g. washing machine, vending machine.\n• A robot adapts to changes (new obstacle); an automated machine cannot.\n• A robot usually has multiple sensors and actuators working in a feedback loop.' },

      { h: 'Robots from the 1900s onwards', b: `Your syllabus focuses on robotics history from the 1900s:
• **1920** — Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. introduces the word "robot".
• **1942** — Isaac Asimov writes the Three Laws of Robotics in the story "Runaround" and later coins the word "robotics".
• **1948–49** — William Grey Walter builds "tortoise" robots (Elmer and Elsie) that move towards light — early autonomous robots.
• **1954** — George Devol patents a programmable robot arm.
• **1961** — **Unimate**, the first industrial robot, starts work at a General Motors plant lifting hot metal parts. Joseph Engelberger, called the "father of robotics", commercialised it with Devol.

• Indian start-ups build warehouse robots, agricultural drones and surgical systems.` },
      { h: 'Four big shifts in robot history', b: `1. **Mechanical → electronic:** clockwork automata became motor- and circuit-driven machines.
2. **Fixed → programmable:** Unimate showed one machine could be re-taught new jobs.
3. **Factory → everywhere:** robots moved from car plants to homes, hospitals, farms and space.
4. **Programmed → learning:** modern robots use AI to recognise objects and improve with experience.` },

      short: [
        { q: 'What was Unimate?', a: 'Unimate was the first industrial robot, invented by George Devol, installed at a General Motors factory in 1961 to handle hot die-cast parts.' },

Trend: from fixed mechanical machines to programmable, mobile and finally AI-powered robots.' },
        { q: 'How has the role of robots changed from early industrial robots to modern robots?', a: 'Early robots (1960s) were fixed arms doing one repetitive job in factories behind safety cages. Today robots are mobile (wheels, legs, wings), work in many fields (homes, hospitals, farms, space), work safely beside humans (cobots), and use AI and cameras to recognise objects, learn and make decisions.' },

      { h: 'The laws — statements to learn', b: `Your syllabus asks only for the **statements** of Asimov's laws. Learn them word for word:
1. **First Law:** A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. **Second Law:** A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. **Third Law:** A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Asimov first wrote them in his 1942 short story **"Runaround"**. The **Zeroth Law** — "A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm" — was added later and ranks above the other three.` },
      { h: 'Order of priority', b: `The laws form a hierarchy: **human safety > obedience > self-protection**. So a robot must refuse an order that would hurt someone, and must sacrifice itself if that is needed to save a person.` },
      { h: 'How the ideas appear in real robots today', b: `Real robots do not "understand" Asimov's laws, but engineers build the same ideas into safety systems:
• **Emergency stop buttons** and light curtains that halt a factory robot when a person enters (First Law idea).
• **Cobots** that limit their force and speed near people.
• Self-driving car rules that make the car brake if a pedestrian is detected.
• International safety standards such as ISO 10218 for industrial robots.
The laws are fiction, but they started the serious discussion of **robot ethics**.` },

A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.' },
        { q: 'Why are Asimov\'s laws important today even though they were written for fiction?', a: 'They made people think about robot safety and ethics. Their ideas — protect humans first, obey people, avoid damage — are built into real safety features: emergency stops, safety cages and sensors, force-limited cobots, and rules for self-driving cars. They also raise questions about accountability when autonomous systems cause harm.' },
