      { h: 'Meaning of Artificial Intelligence', b: `**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the ability of a machine to perform tasks that normally need human intelligence — such as understanding language, recognising images, solving problems, learning from experience and making decisions.

John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956, called it "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".

A machine is said to show intelligence when it can:
• **Learn** from data or experience,
• **Reason** to reach conclusions,
• **Perceive** the world through sensors (see, hear),
• **Understand and use language**,
• **Solve problems** and make decisions.` },
      { h: 'The Turing Test in detail', b: `In his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", **Alan Turing** proposed the **Imitation Game**, now called the **Turing Test**:
1. A human judge (interrogator) chats by typing with two hidden players: one human and one machine.
2. The judge asks any questions for a fixed time.
3. If the judge cannot reliably tell which player is the machine, the machine is said to have passed — it shows human-like intelligent behaviour.

**Strengths:** simple, practical, tests behaviour rather than definitions.
**Limitations:** it tests only conversation (not vision or movement); a machine can pass by tricking the judge without real understanding; modern chatbots can sound human but still make basic mistakes.` },
      { h: 'Narrow vs broad (general) AI; weak vs strong AI', b: `• **Narrow AI** — designed for one task or a small set of tasks: face unlock, chess engine, spam filter, voice assistant. All AI that exists today is narrow AI.
• **Broad / General AI (AGI)** — would match human ability across almost any intellectual task and transfer knowledge between them. It does not exist yet.
• **Weak AI** — simulates intelligence without real understanding or consciousness (the machine "acts" intelligent).
• **Strong AI** — would truly understand and have a mind, like a human. It is a theoretical idea.
In school-level usage, narrow ≈ weak and general ≈ strong.` },

If the judge cannot reliably identify the machine, it is said to show human-like intelligence. Diagram: judge on one side of a wall; human (B) and machine (A) on the other, connected by text links. Limitation: it only tests conversation and can be passed by imitation without real understanding.' },
        { q: 'Differentiate between weak AI and strong AI with examples.', a: 'Weak AI simulates intelligent behaviour for specific tasks without understanding — e.g. Siri, Google Maps routing, spam filters. Strong AI would genuinely understand, reason and be self-aware like a human across all tasks — a theoretical goal; no real example exists yet.' },

      { h: 'Why progress came in waves', b: `• **Overpromising:** early researchers predicted human-level AI within 20 years.
• **Limited computers:** 1960s–70s machines had tiny memory and speed.
• **Too little data:** the internet, smartphones and digital cameras did not exist.
• **Brittle rules:** expert systems broke when faced with situations their rules did not cover.
When results disappointed, funding was cut → **AI winters** (mid-1970s and late 1980s).` },
      { h: 'Why AI took off after 2010', b: `Three things came together:
1. **Big data** — billions of labelled photos, texts and videos online.
2. **Powerful hardware** — GPUs designed for games turned out to be perfect for training neural networks.
3. **Better algorithms** — deep learning (many-layered neural networks), and in 2017 the **transformer** design that powers today's chatbots.
Cloud computing also made this power available to everyone.` },
      { h: 'From rules to learning', b: `• **Symbolic AI (1950s–80s):** humans wrote explicit rules — "IF fever AND rash THEN measles".
• **Machine learning (1990s–):** computers learn rules from examples.
• **Deep learning (2010s–):** large neural networks learn features directly from raw images, audio and text.
• **Generative AI (2020s–):** models that create new text, images, music and code.` },

  c9_a_5: {
    sections: [
      { h: 'The six ethical principles in your syllabus', b: `• **Bias** — unfair preference built into an AI system, usually because the training data is unbalanced. A face recognition system trained mostly on one skin tone works worse for others.
• **Fairness** — the AI should treat all groups equally and not discriminate by gender, caste, religion, region or skin colour.
• **Accountability** — a human or organisation must be responsible for the AI's decisions and their consequences.
• **Transparency** — people should know when AI is being used, what data it uses and how it is used.
• **Interpretability** — humans can understand how the model works internally (e.g. a simple decision tree is interpretable).
• **Explainability** — the AI can give a reason for a particular decision ("your loan was refused because your income is below X").` },
      { h: 'Case studies', b: `1. **Hiring tool:** an AI trained on past hiring data learned to prefer male candidates because most past hires were men → **bias** and **fairness** problem. Fix: balanced data, regular audits.
2. **Self-driving car accident:** who is responsible — owner, maker or programmer? → **accountability**.
3. **Loan refusal with no reason given** → lack of **explainability** and **transparency**.
4. **Deepfake video of a public figure** → misinformation, consent and trust.` },
      { h: 'How to build responsible AI', b: `• Collect diverse, representative data.
• Test the model for bias on different groups.
• Keep a human in the loop for important decisions.
• Explain decisions in simple language.
• Protect privacy: collect only necessary data, store it safely, get consent.
• Follow laws such as India's **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023**.` },
