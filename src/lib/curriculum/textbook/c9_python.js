• A **program** is an algorithm written in a programming language that a computer can run.
• A **programming language** has strict rules (syntax). Python, C++, Java and JavaScript are examples.

Python programs are run by the **Python interpreter**, which reads and executes the code one line at a time. If there is an error on line 5, lines 1–4 have already run. A **compiler** (as in C++) translates the whole program first and then runs it.

• **Free and open source**, runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Raspberry Pi (**platform independent**).
• **Huge standard library** plus packages: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, OpenCV.

Note: int() is needed because input() gives text. Without it, "2" + "3" would give "23".` },
