        theory: `What is Robot Anatomy?
Robot anatomy is the study of the physical parts of a robot and how they are arranged and connected — just as human anatomy studies bones, muscles and organs. Knowing the anatomy helps you understand what a robot can reach, how it moves and what it can carry.

The Manipulator (Arm):
The manipulator is the arm of the robot. It is a chain of rigid links joined by joints. Each joint is moved by an actuator (motor). The manipulator is divided into:
• Base — the fixed part bolted to the floor or a table.
• Arm (body) — the big links (upper arm and forearm) that move the wrist to the right position.
• Wrist — two or three small joints near the end that point (orient) the tool in the right direction.
• End-effector — the tool fixed to the wrist: a gripper, suction cup, welding torch, spray gun or screwdriver.

Joints and Links:
Links are the rigid "bones"; joints are the movable connections. Most industrial arms use revolute (rotating) joints, named after the human arm: waist, shoulder, elbow, wrist.

Drives (Actuators):
The drive system moves the joints. It can be electric (servo/stepper motors), hydraulic (oil pressure, very strong) or pneumatic (compressed air, fast).

Controller:
The controller is the robot's brain. It stores programs, reads sensors and sends signals to the drives. Industrial robots are taught positions using a hand-held teach pendant.

Sensors:
Internal sensors (encoders) measure each joint angle; external sensors (cameras, force sensors, proximity sensors) sense objects and people.

Power Supply:
Supplies electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic energy.

Robot anatomy and the human body:
Base ↔ trunk, shoulder/elbow ↔ shoulder/elbow, wrist ↔ wrist, gripper ↔ hand, controller ↔ brain, sensors ↔ eyes and skin, drives ↔ muscles, power ↔ food/energy.`,

        objectives: ['Create strings with different quotes', 'Use indexing and slicing', 'Apply string operators and common string methods'],
        theory: `What is a String?
A string (str) is a sequence of characters — letters, digits, spaces and symbols — written inside quotes. Python accepts single quotes 'robot', double quotes "robot" and triple quotes '''...''' or """...""" for text over several lines.

Strings are immutable:
Once a string is created, its characters cannot be changed. Methods like upper() return a new string.

Indexing:
Each character has a position called an index. Forward indexing starts at 0 from the left; backward (negative) indexing starts at -1 from the right. For word = "PYTHON": word[0] is 'P' and word[-1] is 'N'.

Slicing:
word[start:stop:step] gives part of a string. The stop index is not included. word[1:4] gives 'YTH'; word[:3] gives 'PYT'; word[::-1] reverses the string.

String Operators:
• + joins (concatenates): "Robo" + "Craft" → "RoboCraft"
• * repeats: "ha" * 3 → "hahaha"
• in / not in check membership: "bot" in "robot" → True
• Comparison operators compare alphabetically (by Unicode value).

Common Built-in Functions and Methods:
• len(s) — number of characters
• s.upper(), s.lower(), s.title(), s.capitalize()
• s.strip() — removes spaces from both ends
• s.find(x), s.count(x), s.replace(old, new)
• s.split() — breaks into a list of words; " ".join(list) — joins a list into a string
• s.isdigit(), s.isalpha(), s.isalnum(), s.startswith(x), s.endswith(x)

Traversing a String:
A for loop visits each character in turn: for ch in "robot": print(ch).`,

        objectives: ['Define computer vision', 'Explain how images are stored as numbers', 'Describe common computer vision tasks and applications'],
        theory: `What is Computer Vision?
Computer Vision (CV) is the domain of AI that enables machines to see, understand and interpret images and videos, and take decisions based on them — like human eyes plus the brain.

How does a computer "see"?
A digital image is a grid of tiny squares called pixels. Each pixel stores numbers: in a greyscale image, one number from 0 (black) to 255 (white); in a colour image, three numbers for Red, Green and Blue (RGB). A 1920 × 1080 photo has over 2 million pixels. So for a computer, an image is just a big table of numbers. The AI looks for patterns in these numbers — edges, shapes, textures, colours.

Common Computer Vision Tasks:
• Image classification — what is in the image? ("cat")
• Object detection — what objects are present and where? (boxes around each car)
• Image segmentation — which pixels belong to which object?
• Face recognition — whose face is it?
• Optical Character Recognition (OCR) — reading printed or handwritten text.
• Pose estimation — finding body joints in a video.

Applications:
• Face unlock on phones and attendance systems.
• Self-driving cars detecting lanes, signs and pedestrians.
• Medical imaging — finding tumours in X-rays and MRI scans.
• Agriculture — detecting crop disease from leaf photos.
• Traffic police cameras reading number plates (ANPR).
• Retail — automatic checkout and shelf monitoring.
• Robots — picking objects, line following with cameras, navigation.

Challenges:
Lighting changes, objects hidden behind others, different angles, low-quality images and bias in training data can all confuse a CV system.`,

        objectives: ['Define NLP', 'Explain the main steps of processing text', 'Identify NLP applications and challenges'],
        theory: `What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the domain of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret and generate human languages such as English, Hindi or Tamil — in text or speech.

Why is human language hard for computers?
• Ambiguity — "I saw a man with a telescope" has two meanings.
• Same word, different meanings — "bank" of a river vs a money bank.
• Different words, same meaning — "big" and "large".
• Slang, spelling mistakes, sarcasm and emotions.
• Thousands of languages and dialects.

How NLP processes text:
1. Text normalisation — make text consistent.
2. Sentence segmentation — split text into sentences.
3. Tokenisation — split sentences into words/tokens.
4. Removing stopwords — drop very common words like "is", "the", "a" that carry little meaning.
5. Lower-casing — "Robot" and "robot" become the same.
6. Stemming / lemmatisation — reduce words to their root: "playing", "played" → "play".
7. Bag of Words / features — count how often each word appears so a model can work with numbers.
8. A model then classifies, translates or generates text.

Applications of NLP:
• Chatbots and virtual assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant).
• Machine translation (Google Translate, Bhashini).
• Sentiment analysis — is a review positive or negative?
• Spam filtering and email auto-complete.
• Speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
• Text summarisation and grammar checking.`,

        objectives: ['Relate artificial neurons to brain neurons', 'Describe input, hidden and output layers', 'Explain how a neural network learns'],
        theory: `What is a Neural Network?
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computing model inspired by the human brain. The brain has about 86 billion neurons connected to each other; each neuron receives signals, and if they are strong enough it "fires" and passes a signal on. An ANN copies this idea with simple mathematical units called artificial neurons (nodes).

Structure of a Neural Network:
• Input layer — receives the data (for an image, one input for each pixel value).
• Hidden layer(s) — one or more layers between input and output where patterns are found. Each node combines its inputs.
• Output layer — gives the final answer (e.g. "cat" or "dog", or a number).
A network with many hidden layers is called a deep neural network — this is deep learning.

How one artificial neuron works:
1. Each input (x) is multiplied by a weight (w) that shows how important that input is.
2. The weighted inputs are added together, plus a bias (b).
3. The total passes through an activation function, which decides how strongly the neuron "fires".
Output = activation(x1·w1 + x2·w2 + … + b)

How does the network learn?
At first the weights are random, so answers are wrong. The network is shown many labelled examples. Each time, it compares its answer with the correct answer, calculates the error, and adjusts the weights a little to reduce the error (this process is called backpropagation). After thousands of examples, the weights encode useful patterns.

Applications:
Image recognition, speech recognition, language translation, chatbots, recommendation systems, self-driving cars, medical diagnosis and weather forecasting.

Advantages and limitations:
Neural networks learn complex patterns automatically and handle images, sound and text. But they need a lot of data and computing power, and it is hard to explain why they made a particular decision (the "black box" problem).`,

        objectives: ['Define deterministic and probabilistic problems', 'Explain why traditional computing struggles with uncertainty', 'Explain the need for AI'],
        theory: `Pre-AI Computing:
Traditional computers work on binary logic: every value is 0 or 1, and logic gates make fixed decisions. A traditional program is a list of exact rules written by a programmer: IF this THEN that.

Deterministic Problems:
A deterministic problem always gives the same output for the same input. There is no uncertainty. Every step can be written as an exact rule.
Examples: adding two numbers, calculating simple interest, sorting a list of names, converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, a traffic light that changes every 60 seconds.
Traditional (rule-based) programs are perfect for these.

Probabilistic Problems:
In a probabilistic problem, the outcome is uncertain, so the best we can give is a likelihood (probability). The input may be incomplete, noisy or keep changing.
Examples: Will it rain tomorrow? Is this email spam? Is this photo of a cat or a dog? Which song will a user like next? Will this patient develop diabetes? Which route will be fastest at 6 pm?
Writing exact rules for these is almost impossible — there are too many situations and exceptions.

Why do we need AI?
AI (especially machine learning) handles probabilistic problems by learning patterns from many past examples instead of following fixed rules. It gives answers with a confidence, for example "92% likely to be a cat" or "70% chance of rain". It also improves as it gets more data.

Comparison:
• Deterministic: exact answer, fixed rules, same output every time, no learning needed — calculator, payroll.
• Probabilistic: likely answer with probability, learns from data, output can change as data changes — weather forecast, face recognition, spam filter.`,

        theory: `Integrating a Robot as a System:
A simple robotic system is built by connecting mechanical, electronic and computational blocks so that they work together. The four-wheeled mobile robot is the standard project in your syllabus.

Parts of a Four-Wheeled Robot:
• Chassis — the base plate (acrylic, MDF or aluminium) that holds everything.
• Four DC gear motors with wheels — two on the left side and two on the right side.
• Motor driver (L298N or L293D) — an H-bridge board that lets the controller set the speed and direction of the motors.
• Controller — a microcontroller board (Arduino) or a single board computer (Raspberry Pi).
• Sensors — an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) for obstacles, IR sensors for line following.
• Power — a battery pack (e.g. 2 × 18650 Li-ion cells = 7.4 V) with an on/off switch; the controller gets a regulated 5 V supply.
• Optional — Bluetooth module (HC-05) for phone control.

How it Steers (Skid Steering):
A four-wheeled robot of this type turns like a tank:
• Forward — all wheels forward.
• Backward — all wheels backward.
• Turn left — left wheels slower or backward, right wheels forward.
• Spin on the spot — left wheels backward, right wheels forward.

Wiring Plan:
• Left motors → driver output A; right motors → driver output B.
• Driver inputs IN1–IN4 → four digital pins of the controller; ENA/ENB → PWM pins for speed.
• Ultrasonic Trig → output pin, Echo → input pin (use a voltage divider for a 3.3 V Raspberry Pi pin).
• All grounds (battery, driver, controller, sensors) connected together — common ground.

Programming Logic (obstacle avoidance):
1. Measure distance in front.
2. If distance > 25 cm → move forward.
3. Else → stop, reverse a little, turn right, measure again.
4. Repeat forever.

Testing:
Test each block separately first (motors alone, then the sensor alone), then combine. Check wheel directions, battery charge and loose wires. Improve by tuning speed and the distance threshold.`,

        theory: `Data Acquisition:
Data acquisition is the stage of the AI project cycle in which we collect reliable, relevant and sufficient data for the problem we scoped.

Types of Data:
• Structured — organised in rows and columns (spreadsheets, databases).
• Unstructured — images, audio, video, free text.
• Semi-structured — partly organised (JSON, emails with headers).
Also: numerical (marks, temperature) and categorical (colour, city).

Features:
A feature is a measurable property used by the model to make a prediction. To predict house prices, the features could be area, number of rooms and location. The value to predict (price) is called the label or target.

Sources of Data:
• Surveys and questionnaires
• Sensors and cameras (IoT devices)
• Web scraping (only where allowed)
• APIs (e.g. a weather service)
• Open datasets — Kaggle, data.gov.in, UCI Machine Learning Repository
• Organisation records (school results, sales records)
Always collect data ethically: with permission, from authentic sources, protecting privacy.

Training and Testing Data:
The dataset is split into training data (usually 70–80%) used to teach the model, and testing data (20–30%) kept aside to check how well the model works on data it has never seen.

Data Exploration:
Data exploration means studying the data to understand it before modelling: cleaning errors and missing values, finding patterns, trends and outliers, and visualising the data.

Choosing a Graph:
• Bar graph — compare quantities across categories (sales per month, students per house).
• Histogram — show how values are distributed in ranges (how many students scored 40–50, 50–60…).
• Line graph — show change over time (temperature each hour).
• Scatter plot — show the relationship between two numerical variables (hours studied vs marks).
• Pie chart — show parts of a whole (share of each transport mode).`,

        theory: `Modelling:
Modelling is the stage where we choose and build an AI model that maps inputs (features) to outputs (predictions).

Rule-Based Approach:
The developer writes the rules. Example: IF temperature > 38 THEN "fever". It is simple and easy to explain but cannot learn — if the situation changes, a human must rewrite the rules.

Learning-Based Approach:
The machine learns the rules from data. We give it many examples and it finds the pattern by itself. It adapts to new data but needs a lot of good data.

Supervised Learning:
The training data is labelled (each example has the correct answer). The model learns to predict labels for new data.
• Classification — predicts a category (spam / not spam, apple / orange).
• Regression — predicts a number (price, temperature, marks).

Unsupervised Learning:
The data has no labels. The model finds hidden structure, e.g. clustering customers into groups with similar buying habits.

Linear Regression:
Linear regression is a supervised learning method that predicts a numerical value by fitting a straight line through the data: y = mx + c, where x is the input feature, y the predicted value, m the slope and c the intercept. Example: predict marks from hours studied — if the best line is marks = 8 × hours + 20, a student who studies 5 hours is predicted to score 60.

Evaluation:
After training, the model is tested on the testing data.
• Accuracy = correct predictions ÷ total predictions × 100.
• Confusion matrix — a table of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives and False Negatives.
• Precision — of the items predicted positive, how many were really positive.
• Recall — of the real positives, how many the model found.
For regression, we look at the error between predicted and actual values.

A model that does very well on training data but badly on testing data is overfitting — it memorised instead of learning.`,

        theory: `Robot Frames:
The frame (chassis) is the skeleton of a robot. It holds the motors, battery, electronics and sensors in the right place and must be stiff enough not to bend, light enough not to waste battery, and easy to make and repair.

Frame Materials:
• MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard) — cheap, easy to cut and laser-cut, good for prototypes; absorbs moisture and is weak at screw holes.
• Acrylic (PMMA) — transparent, light, laser-cut precisely; brittle, can crack if over-tightened.
• Aluminium — light, strong, does not rust, conducts heat; costlier and needs tools to cut and bend. Common in competition and industrial robots (aluminium extrusions).
• Steel — very strong and stiff, cheap per kg but heavy; used for large industrial robots and bases.
• Others — 3D-printed PLA/ABS for custom parts, carbon fibre for drones (very light and stiff but expensive).
Choice depends on load, size, budget, weight limit and how many units are made.

Wheel Types:
• Standard (fixed) wheels — roll forward and backward only; the robot turns by changing left and right wheel speeds (differential/skid steering). Simple and strong.
• Castor wheels — swivel freely about a vertical axis; used as a passive support wheel (e.g. the third wheel of a two-wheel robot, office chairs).
• Omni wheels — have small rollers around the rim at 90° to the wheel axis, so the wheel can roll forward and also slide sideways. Three or four omni wheels allow movement in any direction.
• Mecanum wheels — have rollers at 45°. With four mecanum wheels driven independently, the robot can move forward, sideways, diagonally and rotate on the spot. Used in warehouse robots and competition robots.

Holonomic Motion:
A robot that can move in any direction without first turning (using omni or mecanum wheels) is called holonomic. Car-like robots with standard wheels are non-holonomic — they must turn to change direction.

CAD Modelling:
Before building, engineers design frames in CAD (Computer Aided Design) software such as TinkerCAD or Fusion 360, check fit and strength, and then manufacture parts precisely by laser cutting, CNC machining or 3D printing.`,

        objectives: ['Write algorithms for robot tasks', 'Draw flowcharts using standard symbols', 'Write pseudocode and convert it to code'],
        theory: `Algorithm:
An algorithm is a finite, ordered set of clear steps that solves a problem. A good algorithm has:
• Input — zero or more values given to it.
• Output — at least one result.
• Definiteness — every step is clear and unambiguous.
• Finiteness — it ends after a limited number of steps.
• Effectiveness — every step is simple enough to be carried out.

Flowchart:
A flowchart is a diagram of an algorithm using standard symbols:
• Oval (terminal) — Start / Stop.
• Parallelogram — Input / Output.
• Rectangle — Process (calculation, assignment).
• Diamond — Decision (Yes/No condition).
• Arrows — flow of control.
• Small circle — connector.
Flowcharts make logic easy to see and to explain to others, and help find mistakes before coding.

Pseudocode:
Pseudocode describes an algorithm in structured English that looks like code but ignores exact syntax. Common words: BEGIN, END, INPUT, OUTPUT, SET, IF … THEN … ELSE … ENDIF, WHILE … DO … ENDWHILE, FOR … TO … NEXT.

Example — Obstacle-avoiding robot:
Algorithm:
1. Start.
2. Read distance d from the ultrasonic sensor.
3. If d is less than 20 cm, stop, reverse for 0.3 s and turn right for 0.4 s.
4. Otherwise move forward.
5. Go back to step 2.

Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  WHILE TRUE DO
    INPUT d FROM ultrasonic
    IF d < 20 THEN
      STOP; REVERSE(0.3); TURN_RIGHT(0.4)
    ELSE
      FORWARD
    ENDIF
  ENDWHILE
END

Control Structures:
Every algorithm is built from three structures — sequence (steps one after another), selection (if/else decisions) and iteration (loops).

From Pseudocode to Embedded Code:
Each pseudocode line becomes a line of embedded C (Arduino) or Python (Raspberry Pi). Testing the algorithm with a dry run (tracing values on paper) before uploading saves time and prevents damage to hardware.`,

        examples: ['Algorithm for a line follower', 'Flowchart for a traffic-light controller', 'Pseudocode for finding the largest of three numbers', 'Dry run of a loop that counts sensor readings'],
        summary: 'An algorithm is a finite, unambiguous set of steps; flowcharts show it with standard symbols and pseudocode writes it in structured English. Both are built from sequence, selection and iteration and are converted into embedded code.',
