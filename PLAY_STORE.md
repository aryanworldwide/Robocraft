# Publishing RoboCraft on Google Play

Everything the app needs is already in this repo. These are the steps only **you** can do
(they need your Google account, your payment and your passwords).

## 1. Google Play developer account
1. Go to <https://play.google.com/console/signup> and sign up (one-time fee of US $25).
2. Choose **Personal** account. Google will verify your identity (ID document) and, for new
   personal accounts, ask you to run a **closed test with at least 12 testers for 14 days**
   before you can publish to everyone. Ask classmates to join — the APK link works for them too.
   If you are under 18, a parent/guardian has to create and own the developer account.

## 2. Upload key (signs every update)
Run this once on any computer with Java installed (keep the file and passwords safe — you need
them for every update):

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore robocraft-upload.jks -alias robocraft \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
base64 -w0 robocraft-upload.jks > robocraft-upload.b64   # macOS: base64 -i robocraft-upload.jks
```

Then on GitHub → repo **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**, add:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | contents of `robocraft-upload.b64` |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | the keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | `robocraft` |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | the key password |

The next build produces **RoboCraft-play.aab** under *Actions → latest run → Artifacts*.
Upload that file in Play Console. (The test APK will then also be signed with this key —
uninstall the old test APK once before installing the new one.)

## 3. "Continue with Google" inside the Android app (optional)
1. Firebase console → Project settings → **Add app → Android**, package name `com.robocraft.learn`.
2. Add SHA-1 fingerprints: your upload key (`keytool -list -v -keystore robocraft-upload.jks`)
   **and** the *App signing key* SHA-1 from Play Console → Setup → App signing.
3. Download `google-services.json` and commit it as `android-config/google-services.json`.
   The build switches native Google sign-in on automatically.

## 4. Firestore rules
Paste `backend/firestore.rules` into Firebase console → Firestore → Rules → **Publish**
(new: the `reports` collection used by the *Report* buttons).

## 5. Store listing (copy-paste)
- **App name:** RoboCraft – Robotics & AI (ICSE/ISC)
- **Short description (80):** Learn Robotics & AI for ICSE/ISC Class 9–11: notes, labs, 3D robots, exam prep.
