A robotics learning app for Class 9–11 students: lessons, quizzes, flashcards,
a virtual circuit lab, Arduino/ESP32 projects, revision PDFs and an AI mentor.

Built with React, Vite and Tailwind CSS, packaged for Android with Capacitor.

## Features

- 105 chapters for Classes 9–11 covering the CISCE syllabus (ICSE IX–X Robotics & AI, ISC XI Robotics)
- Full textbook notes in every chapter with 71 labelled diagrams, key terms and a Diagram Bank
- Exam Corner (525 board-style questions with model answers) and timed sample papers with PDF answer keys
- Quizzes, flashcards, games, revision mode and chapter-notes PDFs
- Story map, reward shop, weekly leaderboard, daily reminders and in-app Python practice
- 22 build projects with wiring tables, Arduino/ESP32 code, build sheets and ₹ part-by-part cost estimates
- **Circuit Lab** — wire an Arduino circuit, then edit the sketch and run *your* code on the simulated board
- **Robot Arena 3D** — a real Arduino C interpreter drives a robot car in a three.js arena: line follower,
  obstacle avoider, edge detector, smart waste bin, maze game and PID tuning (syllabus lab experiments)
- **3D Design Studio** — Tinkercad-style solid modelling (shapes, holes, group, mirror, align, snap),
  real robot parts in true millimetre sizes, STL export for 3-D printing and guided design projects
- **Mechanism Lab** — four-bar linkages with Grashof classification, slider-crank, 2R arm forward/inverse
  kinematics, gear trains and Grübler degrees of freedom
- **Internal assessment** — CISCE-format assignment bank, automatic Variable Description Table,
  printable practical file (cover, certificate, index, programs, outputs) and a practical-exam rehearsal
- AI answer marking out of the paper's marks, plus an offline keyword check
- Exam-season mode (countdown + daily plan) and daily spaced repetition
- Accounts with cloud-saved progress (or guest mode, saved on the device)
- AI: RoboMentor chat, "explain simpler", AI podcast, AI project creator, lab helper — with study-only safety rules
- A Report button on every chapter and every AI reply
- Works offline for lessons, quizzes, both labs, the 3-D studio and the arena

## How it runs (all free)

- **Accounts & cloud progress:** Firebase · **AI:** Cloudflare Workers AI (`backend/worker.js`) · **Voice:** the device's own text-to-speech
- Settings live in `src/config/services.js`; see [BUILD_APK.md](BUILD_APK.md) for details.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build                # web build → dist/
```

Android APK: see [BUILD_APK.md](BUILD_APK.md). Publishing on Google Play: see [PLAY_STORE.md](PLAY_STORE.md). Pushing to `main` also builds the
APK automatically with GitHub Actions (Actions tab → Artifacts).

## Project layout
